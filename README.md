# Bayesian MCMC simulations

## Donald Trump Approval Ratings

In this project, we develop a bayesian mcmc simulation model to estimate Donald Trump approval ratings in 2020. 
The R markdown file "poll_DT.Rmd" contains all the code for this project
The file of "poll_DT_gen.stan" is the first bayesian MCMC model using gamma hyper prior
The file of "poll_normal.stan" is the bayesian MCMC model using normal hyper prior, which locates in the appendix section
